 # FluxIQ / Intelligent Streaming
 

<br/>

*The name Flux is derived from the word Fluxus, which means stream or flow, in Old French.*


## Inspiration

At the heart of a digital audience of 1.17 billion daily viewers are the creators who make it all possible. Of the 10 million active streamers today, 3 million have turned their passion into a profession. 
Yet, the drive to succeed often leads to a breaking point, with 30-40% of streamers experiencing extreme burnout due to the relentless demands of the *always-on* economy. 
<br/><br/>
*FluxIQ was inspired by these creators.*
<br/><br/>
Our mission is to empower the next generation of streamers with real-time data and insights, ensuring that a career in content creation remains sustainable, healthy, and rewarding.
